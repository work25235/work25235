            <p data-il8n="s4">Evaporative coolers use water evaporation to cool the air. This technique has been used in warmer climates for
                many
                years. As the effects of global warming are felt in Europe as well, the use of evaporative cooling is becoming
                more
                widespread. In ancient times, Arabs used to hang wet clothes to doors and windows to take advantage of air
                cooling
                through water evaporation. As the hot air passes to the wetted media (in this case the cloth), the water
                evaporates
                and
                the heat in the air is absorbed, which lowers the air temperature.
        
                Likewise, on days when heat causes discomfort, people often head off to lakes or the seaside in search of
                relief.
                Evaporative cooling is, in many ways, simulating the cooler conditions so often found near large expanses of
                water.
            </p>
        
            <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3" data-il8n="s5">How evaporative cooling works</h5>
            <p data-il8n="s6">Evaporative cooling units only use water to cool the air. No chemical refrigerants are involved in the process.
                Moreover, Evaporative air conditioners use far less electricity compared to refrigerated systems: that all adds
                up
                to
                very responsible environmental and energy saving characteristics.
        
                No matter how hot it gets outside, evaporative coolers use the same amount of power and still deliver 100%
                fresh,
                cool
                air inside. This is in direct contrast to refrigerated systems, which require increasing amounts of power as
                outside
                temperatures rise. Evaporative coolers’ cost-saving capabilities actually increase, when the heat is at its
                highest.
                At
                the same time, their performance also increases as temperatures rise – again, in complete contrast to
                refrigerated
                systems.
        
                Using little electricity, no compressor and with low running costs, evaporative cooling is the perfect solution
                for
                industrial and commercial environments, that often have no cooling system installed at all. Air conditioning is
                not
                a
                viable option, because in warehouses or industrial plants, the capital and running costs would be extremely
                prohibitive
                for end-users.
        
                Furthermore, evaporative coolers use 100% fresh outside air. Outside air ventilation is now globally
                acknowledged as
                a
                core component of healthy and comfortable buildings. Evaporative cooling units bring 100% fresh air, never
                recirculating
                indoor air. This can be a great solution to improve Indoor Air Quality, as incoming air naturally pushes the
                stale
                air
                outside of the building from doors, windows or extract system.</p>

                        through
                        these pads, water evaporates and heat in the air is absorbed, which lowers the air temperature. A fan

                        Indirect evaporative air conditioners use a hyper-efficient heat exchanger to produce 100% fresh, cool,
                        outside
                        air,
                        with no added moisture. The fresh cold air produced by indirect evaporative coolers can be similar to
                        that
                        produced by
                        refrigerated systems, with temperatures that approach the ambient dew-point temperature, using up to 80%
                        less
                        energy.
                        The air is indirectly cooled by evaporation inside the core, therefore they are called indirect
                        evaporative
                        coolers.

            <p class="my-3" data-il8n="ss37">Evaporation will take place when humidity is below 100% and the air absorbs water. Any given volume
                of
                air can hold a
                certain amount of water vapour and the degree of absorption will depend on the amount it is already holding.
                When we
                say
                that Relative Humidity (RH) is 30%, we say that air is 30% saturated and it could still hold water for a portion
                of
                70%.
        
                It is the combination of temperature and humidity that creates human comfort, and Evaporative Air Coolers are
                used
                so
                widely around the world because they can create comfortable conditions. Furthermore, comfort is also improved by
                increasing air velocity in hot conditions and Direct Evaporative Air Coolers create sufficient air movement to
                also
                minimise the effects of humidity.</p>
            <img src="./imgs/sec6.jpg" alt="">
            <p data-il8n="s38">As we can see from the graph, humidity depends on the value of the temperature: during the portion of the day
                when
                temperatures are higher, relative humidity is lower. It is during these hot times that cooling is much more
                needed
                and
                it corresponds to the period when evaporative coolers work at their best (when relative humidity is lower). This
                time
                also correspond to working hours: this is why many companies decide to adopt evaporative cooling.
        
                Moreover, we said that outside air is pushed inside the building and doors and windows must be left open for air
                to
                escape (or extract fans installed). This way, also air saturated with water (with high humidity) is pushed out,
                part
                of
                the natural flow of healthy outside air that blows inside the building.
        
                Finally, Hyper-efficient indirect evaporative coolers do not add humidity to the air.
        
                We would normally think that evaporative cooling works in dry Southern European climates. In fact, evaporative
                cooling
                works perfectly in cities like Madrid, Seville, Rome or locations like Southern Spain and Italy, Greece, or
                continental
                France. Nevertheless, there are hundreds of units installed in Northern Europe, for example Belgium or Poland,
                that
                we
                consider humid climates. And…they work perfectly! It is all about choosing the right application, unit and
                properly
                size
                the project, both in terms of number of units and extract system.
        
                For all these reasons, evaporative coolers can be perfectly suitable for all the European climates.
            </p>
        
            <h4 class="fw-bold" data-il8n="s39">Better for health, better for the environment</h4>
            <p data-il8n="ss">
                Evaporative coolers use water for cooling instead of synthetic chemical refrigerants (CFC’s, HFC’s and HCFC’s).
                There
                are no CFC pollutant emissions from evaporative air conditioning and water consumption is moderate. That all
                adds up
                to
                very responsible environmental and energy saving characteristics. Evaporative coolers use far less electricity
                compared
                to refrigerated systems therefore, less fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas are consumed in the production
                of
                electricity.
        
                For example, direct evaporative coolers by Seeley International absorb 1.2 kW power3 to work: less than a hair
                drier!
        
                Nowadays, more than ever, indoor air quality is essential for any workplaces.
        
                Drawing fresh air from outdoors, evaporative coolers offer a great health advantage over refrigerated air
                conditioning,
                which recirculate the same stale air over and over. Moreover, direct evaporative cooling units provide
                humidification of
                the air, relieving dry nose and throat symptoms and asthma. Working in hot temperatures often causes heat stress
                and, in
                some cases, fainting and in rare (but not negligible) cases heat stroke. Improving temperatures in companies is
                therefore necessary and mandatory.

                                the technology that we consider, water directly
                                or indirectly cools the air. For direct evaporative coolers, hot outside air is drawn to a
                                series of water-soaked
                                cooling pads: the water evaporates and the heat in the air is absorbed, which lowers the
                                temperature of the air. To

                                With Seeley International indirect evaporative cooling units, water does not come in contact
                                with the air stream,
                                therefore no humidity is added to the airstream, reaching lower temperatures than direct
                                evaporative cooling units. To

                                In commercial/industrial environments you will be using your evaporative cooler during the
                                hottest part of the day, when
                                the humidity is typically lower. With direct evaporative cooling systems humidity increases
                                slightly, importantly
                                extract fans need to be installed or doors and windows to be kept open. This way, stale humid,
                                hot indoor air can be
                                pushed out and replaced with 100% fresh outside air. If humidity is still an issue, it is better

                            <div class="accordion-body">Evaporative cooling units only use water to cool the air (no chemical
                                refrigerants are involved in the process). They
                                use far less electricity compared to refrigerated systems: that all adds up to very responsible
                                environmental and energy
                                saving solutions.
        
                                No matter how hot it gets outside, evaporative coolers use the same amount of power and still
                                deliver 100% fresh, cool
                                air inside. This is in direct contrast to refrigerated systems, which require increasing amounts
                                of power as outside
                                temperatures rise. Evaporative cooler cost-saving capabilities actually increase, when the
                                ambient heat is at its peak.
                                At the same time, their performance also increases as temperatures rise – again, in complete
                                contrast to refrigerated
                                systems.
        
                                Plus, evaporative cooling units use 100% outside air, whereas traditional air conditioning
                                systems keep recirculating
                                the same stale air, to achieve cooling efficiency, thus negatively impacting on Indoor Air
                                Quality.
        
                                Moreover, when installing a traditional air conditioning unit, capital and running costs could
                                be prohibitive for end
                                users. Installing evaporative cooling units can be far cheaper, plus running costs can be up to

                                A/C performing the same duty.
